Updated Plan Note:

**09/2025 Plan: Scheme 1: Kids' Fun Nutrition Guide**

**Direction:** Develop a user-friendly web system for personalized food recommendations tailored for children aged 3-12 and their parents using WordPress, focusing on frontend interaction and recommendation logic. This is part of a collaborative effort with a team of 4 on the "Food Component Detection for Dietary Recommendation" project, emphasizing growth, immunity, and overcoming picky eating habits.

**Outline:**

- **Requirement Analysis & Planning (1-2 months):** Research existing systems (e.g., Keep, MyFitnessPal kids' modules), define user roles (children and parents), and collect a food nutrient database suited for kids. Evaluate WordPress plugins for customization, including game integration options.
- **System Design (1-2 months):** Design frontend using WordPress themes (e.g., child-friendly themes like Divi or Astra), backend leveraging WordPress CMS with custom plugins, database integration (e.g., via WP Data Access or custom MySQL), and a rule-based recommendation algorithm tailored for children's nutritional needs, incorporating interactive game elements.
- **Implementation & Development (2-3 months):** Build a playful UI with WordPress page builders (e.g., Elementor), custom post types for recipes and goals, integrate APIs, and test collaboration with team modules, incorporating game-like elements using plugins like WP Game or custom JavaScript mini-games.
- **Testing & Optimization (1 month):** Functional and performance testing, gather user feedback from parents and kids, optimize plugin performance and load times, including game responsiveness.
- **Documentation & Presentation (0.5-1 month):** Final report and demo preparation, highlighting the fun and educational aspects, with screenshots of WordPress dashboard, frontend, and interactive games.

**Goals & Requirements:**
- **Functional:**
- **User Registration:**
	Email/phone login for parents via WordPress user management (e.g., using the built-in registration system enhanced with plugins like Ultimate Member or Profile Builder), privacy-compliant with GDPR and child data protection standards (e.g., COPPA compliance for under-13 users).

	Parents can create multiple child profiles, including details like age (3-12 years), weight, height, allergies, and favorite foods. Upon registration, a welcome email is sent with tips on using the site. 

	To add interactivity, include a simple "Welcome Adventure" mini-game during profile setup: a drag-and-drop puzzle where kids match cartoon foods to categories (e.g., "Super Veggies" vs. "Energy Fruits"), unlocking a personalized avatar for their profile as a reward to encourage completion.

- **Health Goal Selection:** 
	Form with kid-specific goals (e.g., growth development for balanced height/weight gain, immune boost for stronger defenses against colds, overcoming picky eating for trying new foods) using WordPress forms (e.g., WPForms or Gravity Forms with conditional logic), allowing parents or kids to save preferences with a playful interface (e.g., colorful sliders, cartoon selectors, or emoji-based choices).

	Goals are tied to age-appropriate nutritional guidelines (e.g., daily veggies 2-3 servings for 3-6 year olds). Integrate an interactive "Goal Quest" mini-game here: a choose-your-own-adventure style game where kids select goals by navigating a virtual food forest (e.g., "Climb the Protein Tree for growth!" using JavaScript or a plugin like H5P for interactive content), making selections fun and educational while collecting "nutrition badges" that influence recommendations.

- **Food Nutrient Database:** 
	100+ kid-friendly foods with detailed nutrition data (e.g., bananas for potassium and energy, eggs for protein and brain health) managed via custom post types or a plugin like Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) and Pods, making it searchable with filters (e.g., by nutrient like "high in vitamin C" or by fun categories like "rainbow colors"). Each food entry includes kid-appealing descriptions, images, and facts (e.g., "Bananas make monkeys strong – and you too!").

- **Personalized Recommendation:** 
	3-5 fun options per goal displayed as custom posts or dynamic pages (e.g., using WordPress shortcodes or a custom plugin like Recipe Card Blocks), including animated recipe steps via embedded videos, GIFs, or interactive elements (e.g., step-by-step clickable instructions), tailored to age and preferences (e.g., <1800kcal/day for 4-8 years, with low-sugar swaps for picky eaters). Recommendations include preparation time, kid-involvement tips (e.g., "Let your child mix the ingredients!"), and variety to prevent boredom.

- **Nutrition Reports:**
	Colorful progress bars and charts for "growth points" (e.g., protein intake +10 points, visualized as a growing tree or superhero meter) using WordPress charts plugins (e.g., WP Charts or Visualizer), with downloadable PDF reports for parents including school lunch tips, weekly summaries, and improvement suggestions (e.g., "Try more greens next week!"). Reports track trends over time and highlight achievements.

- **Compatibility:** 
	Responsive design using a mobile-friendly WordPress theme (e.g., Astra with mobile optimization), ensuring seamless access on desktops, tablets, and phones. Optional image integration for future team collaboration via a media upload plugin (e.g., allowing parents to upload meal photos for basic analysis hooks).

- **Non-Functional:**
  - **Performance:** Load <3s, recommendation <5s, support 10 concurrent users, optimized with caching plugins like W3 Total Cache.
  - **Usability:** WCAG-compliant, intuitive UI with cartoon themes using custom WordPress styling, touch-friendly big buttons, and dual mode (parent/kid) via user role management.
  - **Security:** HTTPS, encrypted data with WordPress security plugins (e.g., Wordfence), no ads, strict privacy for child data accessible only by parents using role-based access.
  - **Maintainability:** Modular code with WordPress best practices, Git version control for theme/plugin development.
